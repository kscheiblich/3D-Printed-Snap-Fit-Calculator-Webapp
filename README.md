# Snap-Fit-Calculator-Webapp

A snap-fit design calculator for plastic cantilever snap-fit joints, built with Python and Streamlit, based on Bayer snap-fit design equations and beam theory.

This tool enables early-stage mechanical design, snap-fit sizing, and parametric analysis of snap-fit geometry, material properties, and assembly forces.

THIS TOOL IS FOR EARLY CONCEPT USE AND IS STILL BEING VALIDATED

FEATURES:
- Plastic cantilever snap-fit calculations
- Multiple cross-section profiles (Rectangular, Trapezoidal, Ring Segment, Irregular)
- Imperial ↔ Metric unit conversion
- Parametric variable slider with graph to visualize variable adjustments
- Browser-based UI using Streamlit
